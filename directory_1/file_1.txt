Cheating is completely acceptable. I use Google to solve most of my problems, and so do most programmers.
You learn by doing. The only way to get better at programming is to actually program. Don’t let an analysis paralysis prevent you from ever starting.

Programmers never stop learning. New technologies come out all the time, so the programmers that succeed are the ones who continue to learn and develop their craft on an ongoing basis.

Programming isn’t like studying for a test. Memorizing stuff doesn’t matter all that much.
