Cheating is completely acceptable. I use Google to solve most of my problems, and so do most programmers.

Let go of your emotions. You’re going to see error messages on your journey to becoming a programmer. When screwing up is such an integral part of the process, you need to be ok with making mistakes in order to grow.



Learning to code isn’t easy. But that’s why it’s worth doing.

Letting problems pile up without checking is a poor strategy. I used to make endless changes to my code and expect it to work right away. The problem with this approach is that it stacks one problem on top of another, and it becomes difficult to figure what went wrong.

Learning by yourself is really tough. Talking about code and collaborating with other aspiring developers is a better way to learn for most people.

You don’t need 5 monitors. Contrary to what Hollywood might tell you, you don’t need an insane external monitor setup to be a programmer. The computer that you own right now is probably good enough to use to start programming. Don’t waste your money.
